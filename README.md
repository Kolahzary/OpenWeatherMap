## Project definition


```
Please write an API to fetch the weather from the following URL and show the weather in Celsius for those two cities. Your API must get new weather every 2 minutes and show all results including (including past data) in a table in your view and paginate the result. For showing the table and making API calls, use Vue.js and Axios. You can also use other external libraries for the project like ag-grid tables or etc.

In the table, if the weather was over 30 degrees, you show the row as hot weather and if it was less than 4 degrees, you must show the row as cold. (it depends on you how you show it, using an icon or changing row colorâ€¦) 

Also, you should have a filter for filtering table results by city name and date. For handling API requests you need to use Vuex. (and call through services if possible)

Here is the requirement for API calls: 
- API Token: 79c06f01f69f3f8a9cb88a7949c4a6d5
